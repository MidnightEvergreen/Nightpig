Evergreen is the first deconstructed MMO built by Midnight, a premium AA game publisher in Web3. This platform allows players to experience immersive gameplay across various games and genres, with the Evergreen Companion app serving as a social hub. Evergreen is currently the largest Aptos gaming project to date and will be the first token in the 'APT20' class to launch.

Deconstructed MMO: This innovative approach offers an interconnected arcade of linked games, each with its own story, setting, and gameplay mechanics, all existing within the larger Evergreen multiverse. 

Evergreen Companion App: The mobile app serves as a central hub for players, providing a unified platform to:
* Manage inventory and assets
* Discover new games
* Engage with the community
* Craft unique items ("Keys")
* Trade in the Midnight Marketplace
* Send followers on missions in the Midnight Mission Table
* Play the mini-game "Midnight Dice"

Interoperability: Midnight's technology promotes interoperability by utilizing the Midnight Bridge protocol, enabling interaction with various blockchains. This allows the platform to scale effectively and tailor its environment to the specific needs of each game.

$NIGHT Token: The native $NIGHT token fuels the Evergreen ecosystem, functioning as:
* A settlement medium for transactions within the platform
* A staking mechanism for exclusive privileges and rewards
* A utility token enhancing gameplay


User-Generated Content (UGC): Evergreen champions player creativity by allowing them to craft and trade unique items called Keys, effectively acting as game mods. This innovative approach fosters a vibrant in-game economy, rewarding players for their contributions.
